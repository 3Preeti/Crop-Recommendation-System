# Crop-Recommendation-System

A crop recommendation system leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to suggest the most suitable crops for a given region based on factors like soil type, climate conditions, rainfall, and historical crop performance. By analyzing data from these variables, the system predicts optimal crops, enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability. Techniques such as naive bayes,regression, classification models, and decision trees are commonly used to make data-driven recommendations, helping farmers make informed decisions and maximize yields while minimizing resource use.
